    section_title: ABOUT CONFERENCE
    section_text: Case-based teaching is a pedagogical approach that engages
      students in the process of making real-world decisions.  Cases represent
      authentic work-place decisions, encourage students to apply knowledge
      gained from the classroom or through additional research to solve the
      case.  Case-based teaching allows the faculty to gauge the ability of
      students to synthesize, evaluate and apply course concepts while students
      are engaged in the process of authentic problem solving.  The goal is for
      students to engage in the decision-making process and determine likely or
      possible solutions.  In health professions education, cases can be
      designed to require students both to draw on existing subject knowledge as
      well as conduct research to resolve unanswered questions.
