If you are a fresh graduate out of college wondering what could be the best road to take, we suggest you go through this article. For those who wish to climb the management ladder, the usual thought process would be to pursue an MBA soon after completing your graduations.

But did you get the right thought?

This article does not tell you what you should do after graduation but instead tells you more about why it is not a good idea to think about an MBA straight out of college.

Would it be right to pursue an MBA soon after your graduation?

Well, if not, then why?

Right in the explanations provided below would you find the answers to this pertinent question- When is the most appropriate time to acquire an MBA?

- In your MBA classes, you would have to attend courses spanning around leadership, organization, and management change. These topics would require your skills, and a lot of experience is necessary to get these classes right.
- Team handling is a critical aspect taught very well in the MBA courses. If you are simply a graduate straight out of college without any specific work experience to count upon, you might not be able to relate to those lectures.
- An MBA can serve you best when you plan to change your careers or plan to move into leadership roles. To be a leader standing atop, you must know your ground very well. But just knowing your ground might not be enough. Thus you may want to have a first-hand MBA degree to accommodate for the gaps you have while you were in your job.
- Experts believe an MBA is not just a degree for use in specific business domains; instead, it is capable of teaching the fundamental skills to a wide variety of businesses. Learning it when you're pretty unsure of what you want to do at 40 could decrease your potential when you need this knowledge that you acquire through your MBA degree.
- The broad scope of an MBA degree can either be your asset or hindrance and depends on how well you're already positioned in the sector. MBA is all about making the right connections and achieving the right objectives, and when fresh out of college, your mindset might not be that broad as is required to manoeuvre successfully through the degree.
- After spending some years in the corporate, if you believe in taking over a subject matter expert's role, MBA might not be a bright choice. Instead, it might be the answer for those who want to become a C-suite executive overlooking many business divisions. Even while working within an organization, your choices could also guide your decision on whether you might pursue an MBA or not.

To conclude, we can say that an MBA is a feather on your hat only when you decide to use its skill sets. Thus, pursuing an MBA soon after your graduation might not be the right decision since it might not help manoeuvre your career in the right path.
