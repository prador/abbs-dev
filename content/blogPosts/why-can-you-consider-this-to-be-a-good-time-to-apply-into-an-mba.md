Reduced fee structures, an extension of application deadlines, levy in the admission procedure are some of the measures taken to fight this sudden pandemic outburst.

An international or national level MBA at this stage of economic turmoil could also be a boon for those who decided to continue with an MBA. An MBA can prepare you for the world that is changing at a magnificent pace today. With an appropriate MBA, you can still ensure a promising outlook with which you can yourself contribute considerably towards the developments in line.

In addition to COVID-19, the digital wave is ideally impacting every sector and field.

The things of today would either vanish or improvise to stay put in the market tomorrow.

Nonetheless, an MBA from a prestigious school remains one of the most sought-after degrees in the current year since it can still promise to place students at the right places even amid so much of changes. It can always prepare you to ask the right questions and solve challenges accordingly by forming a bridge between the old and the new ways slowly and gradually ushering the new ways into the world for practical implementations now and in the future.
