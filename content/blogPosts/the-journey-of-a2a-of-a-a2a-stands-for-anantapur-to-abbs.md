Hello readers, I am Maruru Sai Akhil a final year UG student of ABBS. As part of
my culture and what I have learnt in ABBS, I start with a big wish and greeting
to all of you. I am excited to share my journey to and during my tenure in
ABBS. 

It all began 250 kilometres away at a place called Anantapur where a corporate
brain with a heart of semi-urban mixed culture started the journey at the age
of 18 for his graduation. I am a student at Acharya Bangalore B School (ABBS)
pursuing my fifth semester of the BBA program. Up to 12th grade, I majored in
science, but I also became interested in business. Initially, a cultural shock hit
me when I shifted to Bangalore and this seemed like Zameen-Asmaan
difference. Due to my adaptability, the ABBS fraternity began demonstrating
to me how things operate and function here. I began to learn new things,
making new connections, and gradually improving my skills. Later, my faculty
began to push me toward the spotlight because that is where performance is
accepted. I was made the Class Rep, participated in all the opportunities the
college has to offer, and completed an internship at IIM-Bangalore thanks to
the encouragement from ABBS. I am the proud achiever of the Diamond Level
Certificate of ‘IIM’s Vista’ and received a Letter of Appreciation from the same
for being a part of ‘Young Leaders Summit, 2021’.

I later rose to the position of Campus Ambassador representing the BBA in
ABBS. I was inspired by the corporate interactions I had in the various summits,
conferences and seminars held by ABBS and the bug of entrepreneurship was
kindled and encouraged inside me. My friends and I were motivated to initiate
a start-up named SAASY (Sumukh, Akhil, Adi, Smitha, to surprise U), which is a
party-planning business, on Instagram, and again, it would not have been
possible without the support of the ABBS family. Additionally, I worked with a
fellow friend on the core committee and led the sponsorship team for the
annual ‘REGALIA 2022’, an intercollegiate event, and I can attest that the
knowledge I gained from doing so was astounding. Finally, when it comes to
academics, the teaching and non-teaching staff here are all very welcoming,

and qualified for their own roles and trust me they are there to support you in
all the good deeds you want to do, teach you through the mistakes you make
and guide you through the path you want to lead.

This was my summary of my experience with ABBS, and I hope there will be
many more fun events and good experiences in the days to come. I also want
to thank everyone who has been there for me and has supported me specially
Mr. Ajitesh Basani, Executive Director ABBS and Mr. Shankar, CSO ABBS during
my entire journey. With all blessings, love and best wishes, I aspire to reach to
high in my life and career and thank you ABBS for being always there!.

have learned so far in my journey in ABBS

1. Seize every chance you come across, no matter how big or small.
2. Embrace adaptability.
3. Push yourself out of your comfort zone.
4. Always aim high,
5. Grow and let grow,
   6. Embrace the local culture.

6. It all depends on how you see things from different perspectives.
