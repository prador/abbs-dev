**Why Should Cybersecurity be Incorporated in the IT Curriculum?**

Cybersecurity is an essential pillar that many nations are missing compared to the developed nations despite globally embracing IT solutions in all walks of life.

Cyber-exploiters can target anybody and everybody, but if you look at the current standards of cybersecurity solutions available in India, things don’t look quite promising.

There is a constant threat of cyber-exploitation looming on every individual connected to the internet as digitization has expanded all over the world today.

But what we lack is good cyber-warriors who can deal with these threats effectively. In fact, India is one of the biggest victims of cyber-attacks in the world today, ranking as the third-most frequently cyber-attacked country.

So, this indeed calls for the need to have more and more cybersecurity experts. India currently has an estimated 10000 cybersecurity professionals compared to the overwhelming demand of at least a million cybersecurity experts.

Not much courses exist in the country which talk more about cyber security.

Over the years, Information Technology has become a structured course in the form of various undergraduate and postgraduate courses worldwide. Cybersecurity, as part of the IT course or even as a separate discipline, is fairly a new concept.

 

**What is the meaning of cybersecurity?**

Cybersecurity deals with the protection of the internet-connected devices, systems, and networks against cyber-exploiter attacks. These digital attacks are targeted upon users to access, alter, or sabotage private information, steal sensitive information, and extort money from the unfortunate targets. Besides data and identity-theft and ransom demands, they also aim to disrupt users' regular business and everyday life.

Cyberattacks can be prevented by employing appropriate network monitoring systems to prevent security breaches and identifying system or network vulnerabilities.

It also requires creating user awareness to enable individuals to implement best practices while using digital platforms.

There is a strong need for installing security software with the most advanced features and frequently updated virus definitions.

 

**Cybersecurity courses offered currently in India?**

Specific independent courses on cybersecurity are conducted by the government and private institutions in recent times.

Some are part-time courses, some are long-distance courses, while others are in the form of online certifications, diploma, and degree programmes.

There are currently 204 colleges, including government and private colleges that are offering cybersecurity programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

Government-led National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology has 24 centres that are supposed to launch cybersecurity courses.

In April, 202, IIT madras started the Certified Cyber Warriors v.3.0 course.

Besides this, there are plans to launch several government-backed programmes in various fields like

\- PG diploma in cyberlaw,

\- Crime investigation and digital forensics (to train lawyers and judicial officers).

 

**How can the massive demand for cybersecurity professional be met?**

 

As per experts, the only way to supplement the high demand for cybersecurity professionals is by incorporating cybersecurity as a sub-discipline of the IT syllabus's current course.

According to the PwC report, the cybersecurity market is expected to expand by $3.05 billion in another two years’ time. So, this is the right time to initiate and invest in cybersecurity courses and make the world of internet a better and secure place.
