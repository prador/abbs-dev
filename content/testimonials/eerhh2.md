 I am a student of Masters of Commerce at Acharya Bangalore B School, The faculties are good and easily spoken. They are highly qualified and very friendly to solve the doubts that we had. Infrastructure is excellent. The classrooms are large and well-kept. The campus provides vital services such as Wi-Fi, labs, and a library. The library is brimming with useful literature. The food in the mess and canteen is of decent quality and hygienic. The quality of teaching is good and I have been awarded as a Best Outgoing Student of my Batch. We were engaged with all other extra activities other than our academics, The quality of placement is also good. I am so glad to take admission in this college.

Finally I conclude my words by thanking my lecturer’s and making the students to bring best from them and helping us to build ourselves and for overall development. I thoroughly enjoyed my college days in ABBS.
