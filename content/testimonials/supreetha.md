​​ABBS has given platform to many different students across the globe, where I could experience different cultures, languages and lifestyle. The best experience I have is the annual fest. The annual fest created so much excitement and happiness among us. 
The faculties are supportive and interactive at classes and they made us understand the subjects with effective examples. The industrial visits are the most memorable one. We visited many industries where we were told about the real experience and process carried out in the particular industries. We have a lot of extra curriculum activities and we also had international level conference which helped to enhance our knowledge. 
Overall, we have a best campus with motivating people around us.
