ABBS provides us best in class professional learning opportunities with its highly structured curriculum and excellent faculty. The various club activities at ABBS also add value to this learning experience by enhancing creative thinking. ABBS also gives us an experience of the corporate world through its competitive events.  I have moulded my leadership, time management and team skills during my MBA course.
