 It is a proud moment to cherish the entire life that I pursued Master of Commerce(M.Com) at Acharya Bangalore B school Batch 2017-19. My overall experience was amazing. The college has provided me with a number of opportunities to grow and explore my skills. I have always found a positive and healthy environment and the teachers are highly supportive. 
Presently I'm working as Assistant Professor at Vivekananda Degree College ,Bengaluru-55 
I am highly thankful to you for providing me with an opportunity to be a part of your college. It has added a number of values to my life
