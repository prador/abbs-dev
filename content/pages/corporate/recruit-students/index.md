      ABBS collaborates with academic and corporate leaders to create relevant
      and advanced programmes that are pointed at holistic development. Our
      courses are set to global standards and have gained recognition for their
      application-based approach. 


      The success of our programmes is well-chronicled by our exceptional placement history, with more than 80% of MBA students recruited by the end of their two-year course, and the remainder typically placed by convocation. 


      Today, our time-served placement roster stands at 100%, a testament to our commitment to matching student skill sets with employer expectations. 


      The placement process starts from the admission stage itself where there is a focus on selecting only those students, whose career goals are clear and those who have the right attitude towards completing their postgraduate courses.

      All our faculty members are committed and have extensive experience in

      A large number of respected professionals are also invited as visiting faculty for several subjects or for delivering guest lectures at regular intervals in specific subjects. Industry visits are also a regular part of our curriculum. Our students specialise in marketing, finance, and human resources.
