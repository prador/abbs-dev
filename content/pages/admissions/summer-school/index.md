    section_text: The Summer School offers these students an opportunity to
      understand University life better and build their profile for college
      applications. It provides the school students a wonderful opportunity to
      experience an immersive and application oriented learning. Students,
      across schools, have limited awareness of the value of a summer school.
      There are just a handful of Universities that offer a Summer program in
      the first place.

      The program duration is 30 hours spread across 5 days which means 6 hours
      per day. The themes covered range from Design thinking, critical thinking,
      entrepreneurship, Psychology, Health care, Journalism and media, public
      speaking, leadership to economics and personal finance.


      The program also includes non-academic activities like theater, organic farming, bonfire, sports, yoga, dance, music etc. In addition, we have half an hour per student dedicated every day for competency mapping. A counselor speaks to the students individually and understands their areas of aptitude and suggests academic and career pathways accordingly. This goes very well with parents who are seeking out such opportunities for their children to hone them.  


      In-campus summer school is usually organized during the summer vacations because it allows the students the time to plan their travel and also ensures that it does not interfere with their regular classes.

School education and higher education are different in a number of ways. Summer school at ABBS is an initiative that not only bridges this gap but also orients students to the actual take-away of various domains. It is meant for the students of class VIII, IX, X, XI and XII and is offered in two versions: In campus and Online.
