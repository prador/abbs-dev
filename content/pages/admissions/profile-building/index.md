    section_title: What is Profile building at ABBS?
    section_text: >-
      Every student who applies to any undergraduate or postgraduate program at 
      ABBS  becomes a part of the Profile Building Program - a process to
      identify the ways to improve one’s chances of selection for any academic
      program and to strengthen one’s case for securing scholarships. For this
      we need to understand the major stages of the admission process of top
      universities.


      There are a number of ways in which Universities and Higher Education Institutes (HEIs)assess the applicants


      1. Application Stage
         * Academic Merit
         * Extracurricular Achievements
         * SOP and other admission essays

      2. Post Application stage
         * Written test (Aptitude based)
         * Personal interview

      To help a student in securing admission to leading HEIs in India and
      abroad.


      The Profile Building Program has three major components:


      1. Driving student performance in various stages of the Admission Process.

      2. Outlining and recommending a preferred career path for a student

      3. Encouraging a student to broaden the skills portfolio.
