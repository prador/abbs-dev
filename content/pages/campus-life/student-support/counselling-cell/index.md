      ABBS ensures a student-friendly ambience. The constitution of the
      ‘Counselling and Grievance Redressal Cell’ is a part of our incessant
      effort to create a conducive atmosphere. This cell consists of trained and
      experienced faculty who deal with non-academic grievances, while mentors
      sort out academic matters.
