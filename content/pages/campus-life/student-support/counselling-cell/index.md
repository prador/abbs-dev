      ABBS ensures a student-friendly ambience. The constitution of the
      ‘Counselling and Grievance Redressal Cell’ is a part of our incessant
      effort to create a conducive atmosphere. This cell consists of trained and
      experienced faculty who deal with non-academic grievances, while mentors
      sort out academic matters. 


      ###### Objective: 


      * To counsel students in case of issues in academic performance or discipline and conduct in the campus/ hostels 

      * To promote overall well-being  

      * To help grow both intellectually and emotionally and to be more satisfied and productive. 

      * To improve the quality of life 

      * To provide help in dealing with emotional and behavioural problems like guilt, anxiety stress, lack of confidence, low esteem, depression and internet addiction of any sort, dependency and personal problems that might hamper the academics
