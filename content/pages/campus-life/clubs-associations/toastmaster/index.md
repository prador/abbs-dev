      ABBS’ Toastmaster Club helps faculty members and students collaborate on
      learning and growing. We raise a toast to our efforts and talents.


      The Toastmaster members build leadership skills by organizing and conducting meetings. Club leadership roles and leadership development programs also offer opportunities to learn and practice for the careers students want to build for themselves. Just as the Toastmasters’ learn to speak simply by speaking, they learn leadership by leading.


      ABBS TOASTMASTERS CLUB is a close-knit college club organised by the students of ABBS. It is a supportive and enthusiastic environment where students help each other grow and learn skills beyond communication and leadership. The Toastmasters program specifically targets critical thinking, giving feedback, time management, planning and implementation, organization and delegation, facilitation, mentoring, motivation, and team-building.

      Our TM club has had the honour of bagging the ‘The Distinguished Club’ status for the year 2020-21. Our 100th TM meeting was attended by distinguished guests from various Toastmaster clubs across India.


      This club has helped build skills like expressing effectively, networking, developing confidence and honing leadership abilities which has resulted in impressive placements and exciting careers. 

      All senior members have earned a certificate of ‘Competent Communicator’ which is highly valued in the corporate sector. 


      ABBS TOASTMASTERS CLUB has added value to its members over the years and hopes to continue to do so.
