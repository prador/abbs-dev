The TEDx Team of Acharya Bangalore B School organizes TEDxABBS, TEDxABBSWomen and TED Circles regularly. In the spirit of TED’s mission, “ideas worth spreading,” the TEDx program help communities, organizations and individuals produce TED-style events at the local level. 

TEDx events are planned and coordinated independently, on a community-by-community basis, under a free license from TED.
For our programs, various themes are picked and speakers are chosen for the event. On the 5th of January 2019, TEDxABBS held ‘Reflect’ with 9 talks/ideas about agriculture, sports, art, culture, global issues, mind power, motivation and music. 
TEDLive was hosted in April and TEDxAdventure for the team in June 2019, where team members went trekking to Kumaraparvatha. 
TEDxABBSWomen, held in December 2019, witnessed 12 women speakers discussing topics relating to UN SDG #5 – gender equality, mental issues, fitness, sex, death, and charitable giving. Other discourses on expanding and evolving identities, travel, womanhood, sustainability, invention, recycling and reviving were talked over. 

TED Club of ABBS known as Team X, is continuously striving and excelling in spreading ideas aligning with the global TED platform. The team has around 20 members volunteering for the TEDxABBS Club, including alumni that are an integral part of the TEDxABBS Club. 
Students from the batch of 2019 and 2020 took up various roles in screening ideas/speakers, 
curation, creatives and video production. 

The club hosts TED Circles every month as per the theme given by TED.
