      ABBS’ Toastmaster Club helps faculty members and students collaborate on
      learning and growing. We raise a toast to our efforts and talents.


      The Toastmaster members build leadership skills by organizing and conducting meetings. Club leadership roles and leadership development programs also offer opportunities to learn and practice for the careers students want to build for themselves. Just as the Toastmasters’ learn to speak simply by speaking, they learn leadership by leading.


      ABBS TOASTMASTERS CLUB is a close-knit college club organised by the students of ABBS. It is a supportive and enthusiastic environment where students help each other grow and learn skills beyond communication and leadership. The Toastmasters program specifically targets critical thinking, giving feedback, time management, planning and implementation, organization and delegation, facilitation, mentoring, motivation, and team-building.

      Our TM club has had the honour of bagging the ‘The Distinguished Club’ status for the year 2020-21. Our 100th TM meeting was attended by distinguished guests from various Toastmaster clubs across India.


      This club has helped build skills like expressing effectively, networking, developing confidence and honing leadership abilities which has resulted in impressive placements and exciting careers. 

      All senior members have earned a certificate of ‘Competent Communicator’ which is highly valued in the corporate sector. 


      ABBS TOASTMASTERS CLUB has added value to its members over the years and hopes to continue to do so.

      The TEDx Team of Acharya Bangalore B School organizes TEDxABBS,
      TEDxABBSWomen and TED Circles regularly. In the spirit of TED’s mission,
      “ideas worth spreading,” the TEDx program help communities, organizations
      and individuals produce TED-style events at the local level.


      TEDx events are planned and coordinated independently, on a community-by-community basis, under a free license from TED.


      For our programs, various themes are picked and speakers are chosen for the event. On the 5th of January 2019, TEDxABBS held ‘Reflect’ with 9 talks/ideas about agriculture, sports, art, culture, global issues, mind power, motivation and music.


      TEDLive was hosted in April and TEDxAdventure for the team in June 2019, where team members went trekking to Kumaraparvatha.


      TEDxABBSWomen, held in December 2019, witnessed 12 women speakers discussing topics relating to UN SDG #5 – gender equality, mental issues, fitness, sex, death, and charitable giving. Other discourses on expanding and evolving identities, travel, womanhood, sustainability, invention, recycling and reviving were talked over.


      TED Club of ABBS known as Team X, is continuously striving and excelling in spreading ideas aligning with the global TED platform. The team has around 20 members volunteering for the TEDxABBS Club, including alumni that are an integral part of the TEDxABBS Club.


      Students from the batch of 2019 and 2020 took up various roles in screening ideas/speakers,


      curation, creatives and video production.


      The club hosts TED Circles every month as per the theme given by TED.
