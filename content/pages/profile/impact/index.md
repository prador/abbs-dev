      The ABBS community believes in conserving and preserving the
      environment.

      We have taken up many initiatives to empower; impart and inculcate

      sustainable practices that would impact many lives. 



      Our initiatives range from 200 KW rooftop solar, rainwater harvesting, sewage treatment plants. We have over 400 trees planted on campus, vermicomposting, and drip irrigation installed at our campus. 



      Generating Energy from the Sun


      Using renewable energy sources is the next step towards conservation. Our current system takes care of the internal needs of the campus with excess energy being sent to the grid. 


      This is the first of its kind institutional rooftop solar project in Bangalore. 



      Facts:


      • The grid-tie solar PV system at 200 KW capacity. 


      • Polycrystalline PV system 16.5% efficiency 


      • 3,00,000 Kg of CO2 emissions are saved every year.

      ABBS believes social responsibility materializes itself when it’s
      carried

      out as a mission in its culture and institutional practice. 


      ABBS ISR cares for the development of internal stakeholders such as students, faculty, non-teaching members as well as the local community and society. 


      Our ethical practice in passing down knowledge involves various social and cooperative actions and initiatives. This is done by the rational and sustainable use of resources and, ultimately, in its governance practice, transparency and accountability.


      ABBS has active participation in extending knowledge through awareness drives, rural education initiatives and encouraging care for the environment through teaching, training and research.

      ‘Mahatma Gandhi Center for Conflict Prevention and Management’ was

      established in Ahmedabad, India. Ramlal Parikh, a follower of Mahatma

      Gandhi, encouraged Prof Manas Chatterji to start this centre at Gujarat

      Vidyapith where he was the Vice-Chancellor. The centre was moved to the

      South Asia Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, Australia.


      The centre organized a number of international meetings on Conflict Management, Peace Economics and Peace Science in Bali, Beijing, Tokyo, Mumbai, and Bangkok.



      Community expectations have encouraged the Centre to understand conflict resolution from a wider perspective. The interest of the Centre is to understand these processes by prioritizing socio-economic conditions. 



      At ABBS, our spectrum of research includes not only political, ethnic and religious conflicts but also water, energy, food, migration, environmental and other types of conflicts in the development process of emerging economies.



      We intend to connect this centre with other programs and organizations worldwide. Our focus will be purely academic without any link to political parties or ideology. Each program will be directed to scientific studies of conflict and peace science to prevent, manage or possibly solve the issues at hand.
