      <strong>Taking India Forward</strong>


      <br/>


      Business education and life sciences are two science and technology fields that require tremendous intellectual inputs. The infrastructure for development is currently on the rise in India. 


      <br/>


      We believe that India will emerge to lead the world economy if we choose to continue the path of providing quality education. 


      <br/>


      Along with governmental initiatives, a strong commitment in the private sector is needed to build a proper base for intellectual growth through the establishment of centres of excellence in advanced education.
