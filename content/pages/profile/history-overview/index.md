          **Taking India Forward**


          Business education and life sciences are two science and technology fields that require tremendous intellectual inputs. The infrastructure for development is currently on the rise in India. 


          We believe that India will emerge to lead the world economy if we choose to continue the path of providing quality education. 


          Along with governmental initiatives, a strong commitment in the private sector is needed to build a proper base for intellectual growth through the establishment of centres of excellence in advanced education.
