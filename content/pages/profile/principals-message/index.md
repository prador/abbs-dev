          The pursuit of (Jnan), Knowledge Wisdom (Praggyam) and Truth (Satya)
          was always considered in Indian thought and philosophy as the highest
          human goal. “Education should be directed to the full development of
          the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human
          rights and fundamental freedoms.” 


          I have the privilege to welcome you all to this great temple of learning.  


          In this world life is full of challenges and growing competition, it is quality and excellence that matter. We all are aware that academic success or failure is closely linked with multiple approaches that we are able to provide and maintain in our day to day teaching and learning. Our excellence will not merely be on academic excellence, but also in character building as enhanced by motivational techniques and positive reinforcement.  Our goal is to produce enlightened citizens who will prioritise and plan for higher future for India and also as responsible members of the global family. ABBS, Research and Development has remained and will remain effective to achieve its goals in a dynamic environment. 


          In order to achieve the prescribed destination, education must have twin paths; one is based on the development of certain knowledge and skill and the other leaders to the development of humanist virtue. Likewise, we fully uphold the UN spirit on the purpose of education enshrined in the Universal declaration of Human Rights.

          Hope is a powerful weapon. It inspires us to do the impossible and helps us to do the impossible and helps us to carry on during difficult times. It is the elixir of life that led us amid the pandemic disruption. It is the energy that kept us moving towards to synthesis new ideas accommodates with challenges and reset our thinking and reset our thinking and actions.   


          It has the magical power to make all of you positive and strengthen your life skills to address challenges and secure knowledge and understanding.  


          The year 2020 has been paradigm shift in the thought process and lifestyle of every individual. An entire academic year went online.  We learnt to accommodate ourselves through the digital mode. Every day is a new day with new possibilities. The trials of yesterday have taught us important lessons and readied us for the future. A new day at college brings with it new challenges and avenues for success and exciting discoveries.  We have all the inspiration we need here.  We only have to look for it.  


          The opportunity to be better than we were yesterday is right now. We are committed to arm students with the tools to ask and answer the right questions emboldening them to dream and innovate. 


          This is the commitment we have towards preparing students for the real world. We are optimistic that you will have countless rewards and practical lessons from it.
