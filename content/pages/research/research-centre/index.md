      Research is an indicator of any educational institute’s collective
      knowledge and intellectual worth.  


      At ABBS, research is given high importance as it is imbibed in the vision of the institute. ABBS has established the ABBS Centre for Research (ABBSCR).  


      The objective of ABBSCR is to develop Acharya Bangalore B-School as a ‘Centre of Excellence’ to carry out research in all the programs offered by ABBS.  


      ABBSCR will act as a catalyst to disseminate the culture of research among the faculty and students of the institute, infusing inspiration into academic delivery. 


      The Centre envisages an educational mission to create an ambience for research through knowledge synthesis and dissemination. The ABBSCR offers infrastructure, technology and guidance to faculty, students and doctoral candidates through various stages of research. 


      Seed money and research facilities form a part of the coveted ecosystem that is built around approved projects. ABBS encourages faculty to present their research findings on global pedestals and offers incentives to those who do. We finance conference costs, reward authors of recognised research papers and provide a sabbatical policy to accommodate research requirements. 


      ###### Opportunities 


      Our annual calendar is filled with numerous external research events, symposiums and conclaves that serve to showcase in-house research activities. These events also promote partnerships and alliances with other institutions in the research realm. 


      ###### Guidance 


      The research hub is underpinned by technology specialists, industry partners, associate researchers, faculty members, research staff and postgraduate students. 


      ###### Infrastructure 


      The Research Hub holds a digital habitat. Our spaces are technology-driven, allowing for in-depth programme-backed research.


      ###### Libraries and Labs / Infrastructure  


      ABBS Resource Centre is a library that is equipped and well maintained. We have a comprehensive collection of books related to management sciences, pure sciences, and other allied subjects to meet the present and future needs of its students and faculty.  


      The library’s mission is to provide comprehensive resources and services in support of the teaching, learning, and research needs of the college community.  


      The library has a total collection of 17863 documents (books, journals, projects and back volumes of journals, etc.), 68 print journals, 12 newspapers, 1,50,000+ E-books, and access to more than 15000+ e-journals through online databases, etc.
