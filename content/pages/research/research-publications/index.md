    section_title: ABBS Case Chain 360°
    section_text: >-
      We, at ABBS, have understood the need for developing skills for case
      ideating, understanding the case rationale and coming up with multiple
      solutions that can be cited for effective, managerial decision making.  


      ABBS students enjoy cases written by their own faculty who have a passionate way of discussing business issues and solutions. They work with their ABBS teachers to scout for newer business formats, techniques, solutions and wisdom. Their connection with the company will allow them a closer look at corporate processes, people and technology. 


      The ABBS Case Centre will be a sounding board, bringing fresh case writing concepts, methodologies, and developing a repository of cases of India, Asia and the world.


      The faculty is motivated to work towards publications like **International Journal of Case Studies, International Journal of Management Cases, International Journal of Teaching and Case Studies, Journal of Business Cases.** 


      The faculty case team includes- Dr Padma Srinivasan, Dr Kshitiz Sharma and Dr Ravi Shankar Bhakat and Prof. Joswa Stanly.  


      They will bring 2-4 students of their choice and the ABBS team will have 10-12 members who will regularly meet and work on cases.

      ###### Instructions for Authors 


      * All submitted manuscripts must be; \
        (i) original, \
        (ii) unpublished (including any online publication), \
        (iii) not under submission at another journal, and \
        (iv) not under consideration for publication in another form, such as a monograph or chapter of a book. You may not submit your manuscript for publication elsewhere until an editorial decision is made by the Journal. Failure to observe this rule may result in rejection of your submission. 
      * All manuscripts must be submitted in Word format and must not exceed 8 pages, with Times New Roman font, 1.5 line spacing, 12-point font, 1-inch side margins, and 1.5- inch top/bottom margins. This page limit includes internal appendices, reference lists, figures, and tables. Manuscripts exceeding these limits will be automatically rejected. However, the manuscript must be self-contained so that readers can understand it in its entirety without having to rely on any separate material. 

      * Referencing should be in APA format. 

      * Tables and figures can appear either embedded or at the end of the manuscript. Please ensure that all variables and graphs are clearly labelled and easily understood. 

      * An abstract of no more than 250 words must be included as part of any submission. 

      * On the first page of the paper (cover page), please provide full names (first, middle and last names) and full addresses (institute#39;s address and correspondence address) along with the email address of the author(s). The author#39;s name or affiliations should not appear anywhere else in the body of the manuscript, because our peer-review process is blinded. 

      * The actual paper should commence from the second page containing the title followed by the abstract, keywords, JEL Classification, and the main paper. The author#39;s name should not be mentioned anywhere except on the first page (cover page). 

      * The manuscript should mention the time in which the research was conducted. 

      * All tables, charts, graphs, diagrams should be black and not in colour. The images should be of high resolution and in black and white only. The number and complexity of such exhibits should be as low as possible. All charts and graphs should be drawn legibly and figures should be indicated in millions and billions. 

      * WE WILL NOT ACCEPT HARD COPIES OF THE PAPERS. There is no charge for submitting papers for blind review. 


      ###### Points of Interest 


      * Plagiarism: ABBS takes issues of copyright infringement, plagiarism or other breaches of best practice in publication very seriously. We seek to protect the rights of our authors and we always investigate claims of plagiarism or misuse of published articles. Equally, we seek to protect the reputation of the journal against malpractice. Submitted articles may be checked with duplication-checking software. Where an article, for example, is found to have plagiarised other work or included third-party copyright material without permission or with insufficient acknowledgement, or where the authorship of the article is contested, we reserve the right to take action including, but not limited to: publishing an erratum or corrigendum (correction); retracting the article; taking up the matter with the head of department or dean of the author’s institution and/or relevant academic bodies or societies; or taking appropriate legal action. 

      * Authors of manuscripts accepted by the Journal are prohibited from publishing the manuscript in any other publication (including any online publication) before the manuscript is published in the Journal unless they receive approval to do so from the Journal editor. 

      * Any resubmission of a manuscript that was previously rejected by the Journal will be automatically rejected. 

      * Submissions will be acknowledged via email upon receipt. Hence, it is mandatory to mention a valid email address with the submitted content. We strive to make an editorial decision in under 30 days, but circumstances beyond our control occasionally dictate a longer cycle. 

      * If authors are invited to prepare a revision for further consideration, our letters of invitation will outline the key issues to be resolved and an assessment of the likelihood of success. 

      * Authors are normally given three to six months from the date of the invitation to prepare a revision. Our policy is to strive to make a final publication decision after one or two revisions (of course, further work may also be requested to resolve any remaining issues). 

      * Manuscripts not accepted for publication will not be sent back to contributors. Contributors whose papers are accepted or rejected will be informed by email only.
