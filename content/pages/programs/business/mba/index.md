    accordions:
      - accordion_title: What should I know about the CAT and MAT?
        accordion_content: >-
          CAT and MAT both are national levels entrance exams on the basis of
          which you can get admission to an MBA college in Bangalore also if you
          are willing to get admission to some of the top MBA Colleges in
          Bangalore then it’s mandatory to pass one of the entrances. Candidates
          very often get confused when it comes to picking and taking the
          entrance exam as the CAT entrance score will be a basis for getting
          admission to an A-grade business school whereas the MAT entrance score
          will not be a basis for admission to the top 10 MBA colleges in
          Bangalore. However, they both hold importance when getting admission
          to college so it's important to understand both concepts before taking
          the exams. 


          Many people wonder what makes MAT so important that it is compared with CAT. The answer is that MAT offers multiple attempts for candidates who want to improve their scores in the same academic year. Unfortunately, candidates don’t get this option in CAT as it can only be attempted annually. 


          You should know that both the entrance exams are similar in terms of syllabus and question types that are MCQs but are different in other aspects like topics, exam pattern, marking scheme, difficulty level, etc. In simple terms, CAT is tougher to crack than MAT which opens up more chances for MBA admission in Bangalore.

          discussions and personal interview rounds also known as (GD/PI). The

          MBA as entrances are held on basis of a course and syllabus that can
          be learned over a few months however in the case of GD/PI no one is
          aware of what will be asked or what topic will be given. The questions
          are always random and need candidates to be very confident and have a
          good presence of mind.

          3.  What are your key skills/ greatest strengths? 

          4. What is your greatest weakness? 

          5. What is your greatest achievement? 

          6. Where do you see yourself five years down the line? 

          7. What are your career goals? 

          8. What are your short-term goals? 

          9. What are your long-term goals?

          10. Why do you want to join this College/B-school?
