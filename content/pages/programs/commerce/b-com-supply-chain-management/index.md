      The field of supply chain management is rapidly changing. Today supply
      chain leaders need to source, produce, and deliver products and services.
      They also need to leverage innovative technologies to align with their
      firm strategies and supply chains. 


      We at ABBS, help students explore the course through a financial lens and understand the supply chain networks in global and domestic contexts. This prepares them to address issues such as cost reduction and service enhancement tactfully. Areas of study will include functions of procurement, production, distribution and customer service, along with knowledge on a diverse range of designs and structures.
