      - accordion_title: What is BSC Microbiology?
        accordion_content: >-
          BSc Microbiology or BSc genetics in Bangalore is all about a detailed
          study of microorganisms and their effect on the human body. It is a
          3-year undergraduate program. The course syllabus also includes
          details on different kinds of viruses and bacteria and how they behave
          in a human cell. 


          The minimum eligibility criteria to get enrolled at a top BSc biotechnology college in Bangalore is completing class 12 or equivalent from a recognized board with Physics, Chemistry, and Biology as mandatory subjects. The admission is done as per the candidate's score in the class 12th examination. There are thriving job opportunities available for microbiology students in top industries. 


          BSC Microbiology colleges in Bangalore educate students about microorganisms with particular emphasis on the biology of protozoan parasites, viruses, fungi and bacteria. Microbiologists are responsible for doing the analysis required for the future action against contagious diseases globally, comprehending the environmental significance of microbes and using them for food production, biotechnological and industrial applications. 


          The primary aim of accomplishing this course is to understand the pathogenic potential of the organisms that generate infections in human beings. The BSc genetics college in Bangalore covers elements of the biochemistry, physiology and genetics of microorganisms. 


          The students are firstly provided with learning the fundamental concepts before specialising in microbiology subjects in the second and final years.
      - accordion_title: "What is the difference between BSc biotechnology and BSc
          Microbiology? "
        accordion_content: >-
          BSc in microbiology colleges in Bangalore offers both the courses B.Sc
          Biotechnology and B.Sc Microbiology as they both are the most sought
          programs. However, students pursuing B.Sc Biotechnology will be
          eligible for more career opportunities in comparison to students of
          B.Sc Microbiology. Biotechnology and Microbiology courses are two
          major disciplines of Biological Sciences with diversified applications
          in terms of their domain. 


          The major differences between both the courses are: 


          * B.Sc Biotechnology also covers subjects of Microbiology. BSc biotechnology in Bangalore focuses on Industrial areas, management etc. 

          * On the other hand B.Sc. Microbiology is precise, limited and case study-oriented. 

          * B.Sc. Biotechnology refers to educating students about the manipulation of living organisms at the molecular level through recombinant DNA technology also known as genetic engineering to form useful products for the betterment of mankind. 

          * At the same time B.Sc. Microbiology allows students to explore the world of microbes related to their genomics and proteomics and their applications in food, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries. The main focus of B Sc Microbiology is on microbes and the course includes different factors of Molecular Biology, Genetics, Metagenomics, Industrial Microbiology, Pathology etc. 

          * Choosing a B.Sc Biotechnology course at BSc Biotechnology college in Bangalore can be a smarter choice for a candidate rather than studying at BSC Microbiology Colleges in Bangalore. The reason behind choosing the B.Sc Biotechnology course is that it covers more aspects of biology and thus offers more career opportunities in comparison to B.Sc. Microbiology.
