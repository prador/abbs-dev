        accordion_content: >-
          Business school or B school can be a stand-alone Bangalore b school or
          can be affiliated with a university. Same accreditations can be shared
          as a university and even issue the same internationally recognised
          Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, but it differs from a university in a
          few ways.


          B Schools in Bangalore are designed specifically for advanced business education. If you are planning to take admission to B School you should know that schools are more focused on career development rather than providing theoretical knowledge, meaning that there will be less emphasis on the theoretical part and more on practical knowledge and skill development.


          Bangalore Business School offers a university-level institution that provides business administration or management degrees. A business school is also called a b-school or biz school, management school, a school of business administration, management science, and school of management.
