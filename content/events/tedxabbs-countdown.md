TEDxABBS Countdown is aligned with TED Countdown. Countdown is a collaboration powered by TED and Leaders’ Quest. TED launched its first issue-specific initiative towards climate change, in 2019 in order to champion and accelerate the bold ideas and underinvested solutions that can bring us closer to achieving a zero-carbon world – one that is cleaner, healthier and fairer for all. TED Countdown is dedicated to curating an intelligent, high-impact set of solutions that will put us on a realistic pathway to net-zero – and catapulting them forward. We believe in bringing the ideas in action on our stage through powerful narratives to understand the complex climate issues.
