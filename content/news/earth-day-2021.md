This Earth day-2021 Let's dedicate an Hour to Mother Earth

Earth Hour has become one of the biggest grassroots movements for the environment.

The annual tradition of shutting down electric lights for one hour was started by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

The aim was to encourage individuals, communities, and businesses to turn off all non-essential lights for an entire hour symbolising their commitment to the planet Earth.

This Earth Day, the Community Development cell & NSS, in association with dept. Of Life sciences invite all the members of the ABBS family to come together set the trend of celebrating Earth hour, This will be our first-ever "Virtual Spotlight" Earth Hour, through Microsoft teams platform tomorrow at @8.30 Pm, with Lights turned off, and light a natural lamp.
