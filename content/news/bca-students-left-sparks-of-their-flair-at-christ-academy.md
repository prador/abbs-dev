On an event organised by the Christ Academy on 14th July, our BCA students participated and left sparks of their flair.  In the “Coding and Debugging” event, Mr Manubharath from BCA 4th Sem & Ms Lithika from BCA 6th Sem secured the second prize. In the “Gaming” events too, our students were placed at the 2nd position. Mr Abhijith Mishra, Mr Pratik & Mr Adithya all from 2nd Sem gave a remarkable performance.  Kudos to all our students!
