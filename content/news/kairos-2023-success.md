We always believe in the quote - "Don't Wait for Opportunity, create it." and KAIROS-2023 was a living example of that!

On 28th January KAIROS'23 - "Where Action meet Opportunities" in association with proofile.in was organized at our ABBS campus which focused on connecting best of the best corporates with the aspiring Management Graduates. 

The event turned out to be a huge success. More than 18+ companies with more than 300+ vacancies participated in the Mega job fair; 500+ candidates appeared for the various companies out of which more than 70% succeeded in bagging their dream Role. Candidates also got an opportunity to apply for more than one company at a time, which gave them an opportunity to experience various domains and have an experiential learning. 

Companies from Ed tech, Real Estate, IT & ITES, BFSI & Banking sectors offering packages ranging from 3.5 LPA to the maximum of 11 LPA participated in this Mega Event and were being flexible enough to let the candidates create their professional networks and expanding their knowledges. 

Summing it all, KAIROS'23 was a futuristic approach towards providing a platform for candidates all over Bangalore and nearby places and turned out to be a grand success!
