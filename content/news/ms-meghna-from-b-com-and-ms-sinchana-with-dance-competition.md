An Inter collegiate fest was organized by BNM college, where our students from the cultural committee had taken part in a solo dance competition.  Ms.Meghna from B. Com and Ms.Sinchana from 4th sem BCA made the whole crowd groove with their energetic performances. Ms.Sinchana's performance and energy couldn't stop the judges from running to the floor to break some moves and  as deserving got the first prize.
